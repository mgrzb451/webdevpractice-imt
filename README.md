# Activity Tracking App for my Niece

[Pages Demo](https://mgrzb451.github.io/webdevpractice-imt/)

This is my version of a practice project from the course I've been taking. It's for logging and tracking activities on a map of the users' local area.

## I learned
* working with external libraries (Leaflet)
* using `localStorage`
* using Geolocation API
* OOP in JS, working with classes. Completely changed my approach to structuring my JS code in future applications
* more `async` and `Promises`
* how to create a CSS only collapsible sidebar (that was cool!)
* using CSS `subgrid`
* CSS `-webkit-text-stroke` property
